# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of Walmart sales data, with a primary focus on gaining insights into the performance of various branches and product lines. Utilizing a dataset from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, this analysis spans 45 Walmart stores located across three regionsâ€”Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. Through this project, we aim to uncover meaningful trends in sales, customer behavior, and product performance that can inform data-driven sales strategies.

## Project Objectives
- **Identify Top-Performing Branches:** Evaluate branch performance to recognize high-achieving locations.
- **Understand Sales Trends:** Analyze trends across products, departments, and locations.
- **Explore Customer Behavior:** Segment customers to better understand purchasing habits and preferences.
- **Optimize Sales Strategies:** Use insights to improve forecasting and management strategies for better retail performance.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. It contains historical sales information for 45 Walmart stores across three regions, covering multiple departments. This dataset also includes selected holiday markdown events, allowing for an in-depth look at factors impacting sales.

## Project Purposes
The goal of this project is to use insights derived from data analysis to enhance Walmart's sales forecasting and optimization strategies. By understanding the factors influencing sales at each branch, we aim to provide actionable insights that can improve overall sales management and retail effectiveness.
